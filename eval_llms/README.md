# Introduction
These are the codes for evaluating the quality of generated tabular data of LLMs.


# Usage
* Generated tabular data: Given the benchmark dataset with causal graph and tabular data in "dataset data/sim_lu/100", the corresponding generated tabular data should be saved in directory: "synthetic/sim_lu/100/qwen_100i.csv".  
* Evaluation results: the evaluated results will be saved in "results/" according to different LLMs.
