Given the structure of the causal graph and the list of parents for each node, we can deduce the children of each node by tracing back the directed edges. However, since the direct list of children for each node isn't provided, I'll infer the children based on the parent-child relationships described:

1. **V1** has **V2** as its child.
2. **V3** has **V5** as its child.
3. **V4** has no child listed.
4. **V7** has **V8**, **V9**, **V11**, and **V13** as its children.
5. **V9** has **V10** as its child.
6. **V10** has **V17** as its child.
7. **V11** has **V29** as its child.
8. **V12** has no child listed.
9. **V13** has **V20** as its child.
10. **V14** has **V20** as its child.
11. **V15** has **V21** as its child.
12. **V16** has no child listed.
13. **V17** has **V18** as its child.
14. **V18** has **V19** as its child.
15. **V21** has **V22** as its child.
16. **V22** has **V24** as its child.
17. **V23** has **V23** as its child (indicating self-reference).
18. **V24** has **V26** as its child.
19. **V25** has no child listed.
20. **V26** has **V27** as its child.
21. **V27** has **V22** as its child (indicating a loop or an error in the listing).
22. **V28** has no child listed.
23. **V29** has **V33** as its child.
24. **V30** has **V31** as its child (indicating a loop or an error in the listing).
25. **V31** has no child listed.
26. **V32** has **V3** and **V10**, **V11** as its children.
27. **V33** has **V34** as its child.
28. **V34** has **V35** as its child.
29. **V35** has **V36** as its child.
30. **V36** has **V40** as its child.
31. **V37** has **V41** as its child.
32. **V38** has no child listed.
33. **V39** has **V42** as its child.
34. **V40** has **V42** as its child.
35. **V41** has **V43** as its child.
36. **V42** has **V43** as its child.
37. **V43** has no child listed.
38. **V44** has **V45** as its child.
39. **V45** has **V46** as its child.
40. **V46** has no child listed.
41. **V47** has **V48** as its child.
42. **V48** has no child listed.
43. **V49** has **V42**, **V44**, **V45** as its children.

This summary provides the children of each node based on the parent-child relationships described in the initial information.
