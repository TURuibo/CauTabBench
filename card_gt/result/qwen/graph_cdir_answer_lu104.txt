In a causal graph, the children of a node are the nodes that have directed edges coming from it. Based on the information provided for this causal graph:

- **Node V0** does not have any children as it is not connected to any other node with an outgoing edge.
- **Node V1** has one child: V3.
- **Node V2** also has one child: V7.
- **Node V3** has one child: V6.
- **Node V5** has one child: V6.
- **Node V7** has one child: V8.

So, summarizing the children of each node:

- **V0**: No children
- **V1**: V3
- **V2**: V7
- **V3**: V6
- **V5**: V6
- **V7**: V8
