Based on the provided information about the causal graph and its edges, we can summarize the children of each node as follows:

- Children of **V0** are none.
- Children of **V1** are **V2** and **V3**.
- Children of **V2** are **V6**.
- Children of **V3** are **V6**.
- Children of **V4** are **V6**.
- Children of **V5** are **V6**.
- Children of **V6** are **V0**, **V1**, **V2**, **V3**, **V4**, **V5**, and **V8**.
- Children of **V7** are none.
- Children of **V8** are **V0** and **V1**.

This summary lists all the nodes that are directly influenced by (or are children of) each specified node based on the causal relationships depicted by the edges in the graph.
