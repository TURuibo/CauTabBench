To summarize the children of each node in the causal graph based on the provided information, we'll look at the direction of the arrows (edges), which indicate causality. Since the original query was about parents, let's now consider the reverse perspective for children:

- **V0** has **children**: V2, V6
- **V1** has **children**: V4, V5, V6
- **V2** has **children**: V4, V6
- **V3** has **children**: V8
- **V5** has **children**: V7

In this summary, each node is associated with the nodes that it directly influences or causes according to the causal relationships depicted by the directed edges in the graph.
