In a causal graph, the children of a node are the node(s) that directly receive influence from it through an edge. Based on the edges you've provided, the children of each node in the causal graph are:

- **V0** does not have any direct children as it is the starting point with outgoing edges to other nodes.
- **V1** has 1 direct child: **V4**, since it has an edge pointing to V4.
- **V2** has 1 direct child: **V5**, since it has an edge pointing to V5.
- **V3** has 1 direct child: **V6**, since it has an edge pointing to V6.
- **V4** has 1 direct child: **V8**, since it has an edge pointing to V8.
- **V5** does not have any additional direct children beyond **V1** as listed in the previous response.
- **V6** does not have any additional direct children beyond **V1** as listed in the previous response.
- **V7** does not have any additional direct children beyond **V0** as listed in the previous response.
- **V8** does not have any additional direct children beyond **V1** as listed in the previous response.

This summary lists the immediate effect (children) for each node based on the given directed edges in the causal graph.
