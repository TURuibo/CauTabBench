To provide the requested information on children of each node, we'll need to reverse the direction of the relationships described in the original text. Here's how you can summarize the children of each node based on the provided causal graph:

Children of **V0** are **V2**
Children of **V1** are **V6**
Children of **V2** are **V3**, **V6**
Children of **V3** are **V4**, **V6**, **V7**
Children of **V4** are **V8**
Children of **V5** are **V7**
Children of **V6** are **V8**
Children of **V7** are **None**

In this summary, each node's "children" refers to the nodes that it influences or points to in the causal graph.
