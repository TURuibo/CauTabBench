To provide the summary of children for each node based on the given parents' information, we need to reverse-engineer this data since the direct children relationship isn't explicitly provided. However, understanding that the "parents" of a node indicate which nodes have directed edges pointing towards it, we can infer that the children of a node are those that point outwards from it. Given that we only have the parent nodes and no direct child nodes, we will assume that if a node appears multiple times in the list, it could potentially be pointing towards itself or other nodes in a way that isn't represented here.

Given this context, let's summarize the potential "children" for each node based on the assumption that a node pointing to another node would appear in both the "parents" and "children" lists. However, without explicit information about outgoing edges, we'll focus on interpreting the input as indicating nodes that might influence or connect to others:

This interpretation assumes that a node appearing multiple times in the list could be pointing to itself or potentially influencing other nodes, though this is speculative based on the given data. Without explicit information on outgoing edges, these summaries are hypothetical connections inferred from the provided parent-child relationships.
