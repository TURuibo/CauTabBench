Based on the provided information about the causal graph, I will summarize the children of each node as requested:

Children of **V0** are **V1**, **V2**, **V3**, and **V7**.

Children of **V1** are **V3** and **V8**.

Children of **V2** are **V5** and **V8**.

Children of **V3** are **V8**.

Children of **V4** are **V7** and **V8**.

Children of **V5** are none (since there are no specified children).

Children of **V6** are none (since there are no specified children).

Children of **V7** are **V8**.

Children of **V8** are none (since there are no specified children).
