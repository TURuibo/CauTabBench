Based on the provided information about the parent nodes in the causal graph, we can infer the children of each node by reversing the direction of the relationships described. However, since the direct information about children isn't explicitly given, I will assume you're asking for a hypothetical summary based on typical understanding of causal graphs and the given structure.

Given that in a causal graph, if a node has parents, it typically implies that this node could potentially have children as well, depending on the context and additional relationships not mentioned here. Below is a hypothetical summary of potential children for each node based on the assumption that each parent node could contribute to influencing other nodes through directed edges:

Please note that this summary is hypothetical and assumes a general understanding of how causal graphs might function. The actual children of each node would depend on the specific connections defined within the causal graph.
