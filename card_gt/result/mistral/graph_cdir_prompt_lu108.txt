 [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You are extracting parents and children of nodes from given responses. The response is:  In a causal graph, each node has parents and children. The parents of a node are the nodes that directly influence it, while the children of a node are the nodes that directly influence other nodes.\n\nFor example, in this causal graph:\n\n* V0 has parents V1, V2, V3, V7\n* V1 has children V3\n* V2 has children V5, V9\n* V3 has children V5, V8\n* V4 has children V7\n* V5 has children V8, V9\n* V6 has children V7\n* V7 has children V8, V9\n* V8 has children V9\n* V9 has children V5\n\nNote that V0 has no children, as it does not directly influence any other nodes in the graph.. The result in the format: Parents of XXX are XXX, ... Children of XXX are XXX, ... where XXX should be replaced by nodes.'}]
