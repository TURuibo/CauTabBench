  The parents and children of each node in the causal graph are as follows:

* V0 has one parent: V2
* V1 has one parent: V6
* V2 has one parent: V0 and one child: V3
* V3 has one parent: V2 and two children: V4 and V6
* V4 has one parent: V3 and one child: V7
* V5 has one parent: V7 and one child: V9
* V6 has one parent: V3 and one child: V8
* V7 has one parent: V4 and one child: V9
* V8 has one parent: V6
* V9 has one parent: V3 and one child: V9

Note that V3 has two children, V4 and V6, since it is a node with multiple edges in the causal graph.
