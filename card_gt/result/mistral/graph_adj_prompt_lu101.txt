 [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You are extracting neighbor information from given responses. The response is:  The neighbors of each node in the causal graph are as follows:\n\n* V0: V1, V3\n* V1: V2\n* V2: V1\n* V3: V0\n* V4: V7\n* V5: V6\n* V6: V8\n* V7: V4, V8\n* V8: V6\n* V9: None (since V9 is not connected to any other node in the graph).  The result in the format: Neighbors of XXX are XXX, ... where XXX should be replaced by nodes.'}]
