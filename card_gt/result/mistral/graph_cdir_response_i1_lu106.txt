response:
  To determine the parents and children of each node in the causal graph, we need to traverse the edges and follow the direction of causality. Here are the parents and children of each node:

* V0: Parents: None, Children: V2, V4, V6
* V1: Parents: None, Children: V2, V3
* V2: Parents: V0, V1, Children: V4, V5
* V3: Parents: V1, Children: V5, V8, V9
* V4: Parents: V0, Children: V8
* V5: Parents: V2, Children: V6, V7
* V6: Parents: V0, Children: None
* V7: Parents: V5, Children: None
* V8: Parents: V4, Children: None
* V9: Parents: V3, Children: None

Note that the edges are directed, so the causality flows from the parent node to the child node.
