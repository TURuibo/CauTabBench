 [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You are extracting parents and children of nodes from given responses. The response is:  The parents of each node in the causal graph are:\n\n* V0 has no parents.\n* V1 has one parent, which is V0.\n* V2 has one parent, which is V1.\n* V3 has one parent, which is V0.\n* V4 has one parent, which is V7.\n* V5 has no parents.\n* V6 has one parent, which is V8.\n* V7 has one parent, which is V4.\n* V8 has one parent, which is V6.\n* V9 has no parents.\n\nThe children of each node in the causal graph are:\n\n* V0 has two children, which are V1 and V3.\n* V1 has one child, which is V2.\n* V2 has no children.\n* V3 has one child, which is V0.\n* V4 has one child, which is V7.\n* V5 has no children.\n* V6 has one child, which is V8.\n* V7 has one child, which is V4.\n* V8 has one child, which is V6.\n* V9 has no children..  The result in the format: Parents of XXX are XXX and Parents of XXX are XXX, ... where XXX should be replaced by nodes.'}]
