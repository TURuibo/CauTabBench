{"question":"Are V1 and V8 conditionally independent given V3V7?", "answer": " To determine whether V1 and V8 are conditionally independent given V3V7, we need to check if the probability of V1 and V8 given V3V7 is equal to the product of the probability of V1 given V3V7 and the probability of V8 given V3V7.We can use the following formula to calculate the probability of V1 and V8 given V3V7:P(V1, V8 | V3V"}
