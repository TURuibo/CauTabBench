  In a causal graph, the parents of a node are the nodes that directly influence or cause the node, while the children of a node are the nodes that are directly influenced or caused by the node.

For node V0, the parent is V2, and the children are V3 and V6.

For node V1, the parent is V6, and the children are V3 and V9.

For node V2, the parent is V0, and the children are V3 and V6.

For node V3, the parents are V2 and V3, and the children are V4, V6, and V9.

For node V4, the parent is V3, and the child is V7.

For node V5, the parent is V7, and the child is V9.

For node V6, the parents are V1 and V2, and the children are V3 and V9.

For node V7, the parent is V4, and the child is V5.

For node V8, the parent is V6, and the child is V9.
