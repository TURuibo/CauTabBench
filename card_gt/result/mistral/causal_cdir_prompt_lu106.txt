 [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You are extracting parents and children of nodes from given responses. The response is:  The parents of each node in the causal graph are as follows:\r\n\r\n- V0: V1, V2, V4, V6\r\n- V1: V2, V3\r\n- V2: V0, V4, V5\r\n- V3: V1, V8, V9\r\n- V4: V2, V8\r\n- V5: V2, V6, V7\r\n- V6: V0, V5\r\n- V7: V5\r\n- V8: V3, V4\r\n- V9: V3, V8\r\n\r\nThe children of each node in the causal graph are as follows:\r\n\r\n- V0: V2, V4, V6\r\n- V1: V2, V3\r\n- V2: V4, V5\r\n- V3: V8, V9\r\n- V4: V8\r\n- V5: V6, V7\r\n- V6: V7\r\n- V7: V8\r\n- V8: V9\r\n- V9: V9\r\n\r\nNote that some nodes have multiple children, while others have no children..  The result in the format: Parents of XXX are XXX and Parents of XXX are XXX, ... where XXX should be replaced by nodes.'}]
