  Here are the neighbors of each node in the causal graph:

* V0: V2, V3, V7
* V1: V2, V3, V5, V6, V8
* V2: V4, V6, V8
* V3: V2, V7
* V4: V2
* V5: V1, V6
* V6: V1, V2, V8, V9
* V7: V0, V3
* V8: V1, V2, V6
* V9: V6

Note that the causal graph has a directed edge between each pair of nodes, so the neighbors of a node are the nodes that are connected to it by an edge.
