 [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You are extracting parents and children of nodes from given responses. The response is:  The parents and children of each node in the causal graph are:\n\n* V0 has no parents or children.\n* V1 has no parents or children.\n* V2 has no parents or children.\n* V3 has one parent (V0) and one child (V5).\n* V4 has one parent (V3) and two children (V5 and V9).\n* V5 has two parents (V3 and V4) and one child (V6).\n* V6 has one parent (V5) and two children (V7 and V8).\n* V7 has one parent (V6) and one child (V9).\n* V8 has one parent (V6) and no children.\n* V9 has one parent (V4) and one child (V7).. The result in the format: Parents of XXX are XXX, ... Children of XXX are XXX, ... where XXX should be replaced by nodes.'}]
