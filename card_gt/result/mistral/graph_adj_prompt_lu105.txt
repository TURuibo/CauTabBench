 [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You are extracting neighbor information from given responses. The response is:  The neighbors of each node in the causal graph are:\n\n* V0: V5, V9\n* V1: V2, V3\n* V2: V6\n* V3: V8\n* V4: V6\n* V5: V0, V9\n* V6: V2, V4\n* V7: V8\n* V8: V3, V6\n* V9: V0, V5\n\nNote that in a causal graph, the neighbors of a node are the nodes that are directly connected to it by an edge..  The result in the format: Neighbors of XXX are XXX, ... where XXX should be replaced by nodes.'}]
