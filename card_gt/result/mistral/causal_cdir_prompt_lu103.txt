 [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You are extracting parents and children of nodes from given responses. The response is:  The parents of each node in the causal graph are:\n\n* V0 has parents V0 -> V1, V0 -> V2, V0 -> V3, and V0 -> V9\n* V1 has parent V0\n* V2 has parent V0\n* V3 has parent V0\n* V9 has parent V0\n* V4 has parents V4 -> V6 and V4 -> V8\n* V6 has parent V4 -> V6\n* V8 has parent V4 -> V8\n* V7 has parent V5 -> V7\n* V5 has no parents\n* V9 has parent V0\n\nThe children of each node in the causal graph are:\n\n* V0 has children V1, V2, V3, V9, V6, V8, V7, and V5\n* V1 has child V0\n* V2 has child V0\n* V3 has child V0\n* V9 has child V0\n* V4 has children V6 and V8\n* V6 has child V4 -> V6\n* V8 has child V4 -> V8\n* V7 has child V5\n* V5 has no children\n* V9 has child V0.  The result in the format: Parents of XXX are XXX and Parents of XXX are XXX, ... where XXX should be replaced by nodes.'}]
