{"question":"Are V0 and V2 conditionally independent given V1?", "answer": " No."}
{"question":"Are V1 and V3 conditionally independent given V0?", "answer": " No, V1 and V3 are not conditionally independent given V0."}
{"question":"Are V2 and V3 conditionally independent given V0?", "answer": " No, V2 and V3 are not conditionally independent given V0."}
{"question":"Are V4 and V8 conditionally independent given V7?", "answer": " To determine whether V4 and V8 are conditionally independent given V7, we need to calculate the conditional probability of V4 and V8 given V7.The conditional probability of V4 given V7 is:P(V4|V7) = P(V4,V7) / P(V7) = (0.8429, 0.8552, 0.7397, 0."}
