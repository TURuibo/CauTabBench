 [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You are extracting parents and children of nodes from given responses. The response is:  In a causal graph, the parents of a node are the nodes that directly influence or cause the node, while the children of a node are the nodes that are directly influenced or caused by the node.\n\nFor node V0, the parent is V2, and the children are V3 and V6.\n\nFor node V1, the parent is V6, and the children are V3 and V9.\n\nFor node V2, the parent is V0, and the children are V3 and V6.\n\nFor node V3, the parents are V2 and V3, and the children are V4, V6, and V9.\n\nFor node V4, the parent is V3, and the child is V7.\n\nFor node V5, the parent is V7, and the child is V9.\n\nFor node V6, the parents are V1 and V2, and the children are V3 and V9.\n\nFor node V7, the parent is V4, and the child is V5.\n\nFor node V8, the parent is V6, and the child is V9.\n\nFor node V9, the parents are V3 and V6, and the child is V8..  The result in the format: Parents of XXX are XXX and Parents of XXX are XXX, ... where XXX should be replaced by nodes.'}]
