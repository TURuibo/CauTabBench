response:
  To determine the parents and children of each node in the causal graph, we need to follow the edges in the graph. Here are the parent-child relationships for each node:

* V0: parents: V0, children: V1, V2, V3, V9
* V1: parents: V0, children: V0
* V2: parents: V0, children: V0
* V3: parents: V0, children: V0
* V4: parents: V4, children: V6, V8
* V6: parents: V4, children: V8
* V7: parents: V5, children: V5
* V8: parents: V4, V6, children: V0
* V9: parents: V0, children: V0

Note that some nodes have no children, as they are not connected to any other nodes in the graph.
