  The parents of each node in the causal graph are:

* V0 has parents V0 -> V1, V0 -> V2, V0 -> V3, and V0 -> V9
* V1 has parent V0
* V2 has parent V0
* V3 has parent V0
* V9 has parent V0
* V4 has parents V4 -> V6 and V4 -> V8
* V6 has parent V4 -> V6
* V8 has parent V4 -> V8
* V7 has parent V5 -> V7
* V5 has no parents
* V9 has parent V0

The children of each node in the causal graph are:

* V0 has children V1, V2, V3, V9, V6, V8, V7, and V5
* V1 has child V0
* V2 has child V0
* V3 has child V0
* V9 has child V0
* V4 has children V6 and V8
* V6 has child V4 -> V6
* V8 has child V4 -> V8
* V7 has child V5
* V5 has no children
* V9 has child V0
