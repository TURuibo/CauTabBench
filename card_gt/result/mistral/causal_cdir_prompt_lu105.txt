 [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You are extracting parents and children of nodes from given responses. The response is:  The parents of each node in the causal graph are:\n\n* V0: V5, V9\n* V1: V2, V3\n* V2: V6\n* V3: V8\n* V4: V6\n* V5: None\n* V6: V8\n* V7: None\n* V8: None\n* V9: None\n\nThe children of each node in the causal graph are:\n\n* V0: None\n* V1: None\n* V2: None\n* V3: None\n* V4: None\n* V5: None\n* V6: None\n* V7: None\n* V8: None\n* V9: None\n\nNote that the parents and children of each node are determined by the edges of the causal graph. The parents of a node are the nodes that are connected to it with directed edges, and the children of a node are the nodes that are connected to it with directed edges in the opposite direction..  The result in the format: Parents of XXX are XXX and Parents of XXX are XXX, ... where XXX should be replaced by nodes.'}]
