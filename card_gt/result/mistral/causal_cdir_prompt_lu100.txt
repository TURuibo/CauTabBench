 [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You are extracting parents and children of nodes from given responses. The response is:  To determine the parents and children of each node in the causal graph, we need to traverse the edges and keep track of the incoming and outgoing edges for each node.\n\n1. Node V0 has no incoming or outgoing edges.\n2. Node V1 has no incoming or outgoing edges.\n3. Node V2 has no incoming or outgoing edges.\n4. Node V3 has one incoming edge from V0 and one outgoing edge to V5.\n5. Node V4 has one incoming edge from V0 and one outgoing edge to V5 and V9.\n6. Node V5 has two incoming edges from V3 and V4, and one outgoing edge to V6.\n7. Node V6 has one incoming edge from V4 and one outgoing edge to V7 and V8.\n8. Node V7 has one incoming edge from V6 and one outgoing edge to V9.\n9. Node V8 has one incoming edge from V6 and one outgoing edge to V9.\n10. Node V9 has one incoming edge from V5 and one outgoing edge to V7 and V8.\n\nTherefore, the parents and children of each node in the causal graph are as follows:\n\n* Node V0 has no parents and no children.\n* Node V1 has no parents and no children.\n* Node V2 has no parents and no children.\n* Node V3 has parents V0 and V1, and children V5 and V6.\n* Node V4 has parents V0 and V3, and children V5 and V9.\n* Node V5 has parents V3 and V4, and children V6 and V7.\n* Node V6 has parents V4 and V5, and children V7 and V8.\n* Node V7 has parents V6 and V9, and children V8.\n* Node V8 has parents V6 and V9, and children V7 and V9.\n* Node V9 has parents V5 and V6, and children V7, V8, and V9..  The result in the format: Parents of XXX are XXX and Parents of XXX are XXX, ... where XXX should be replaced by nodes.'}]
