{"question":"Are V7 and V9 conditionally independent given V6?", "answer": " No, V7 and V9 are not conditionally independent given V6.Explanation:We can see from the table that V7 and V9 are not independent given V6 because the probability of V7 and V9 occurring together depends on the value of V6. Specifically, the probability of V7 and V9 occurring together is higher when V6 is equal to 1 than when V6 is equal to 0. This means that the occurrence"}
