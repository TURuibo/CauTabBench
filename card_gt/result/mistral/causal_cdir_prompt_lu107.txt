 [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You are extracting parents and children of nodes from given responses. The response is:  In a causal graph, each node has a set of parents (also known as the causal ancestors) and a set of children (also known as the causal descendants).\n\nThe parents of each node in the causal graph are:\n\n* V0: V3, V4\n* V1: V3\n* V2: V6, V8\n* V3: V4\n* V4: V0\n* V5: V6, V8\n* V6: V2\n* V7: V5\n* V8: V2\n* V9: V7\n\nThe children of each node in the causal graph are:\n\n* V0: V3, V4\n* V1: V3\n* V2: V6, V8\n* V3: V4\n* V4: V0\n* V5: V6, V8\n* V6: V2\n* V7: V5\n* V8: V2\n* V9: V7\n\nNote that a node can have multiple parents, but only one child node..  The result in the format: Parents of XXX are XXX and Parents of XXX are XXX, ... where XXX should be replaced by nodes.'}]
