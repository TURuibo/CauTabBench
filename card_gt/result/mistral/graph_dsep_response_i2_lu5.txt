 Yes, based on the response, we can determine whether V39 and V49 are d-separated given V25 by using a depth-first search algorithm to traverse the causal graph and checking if there is a path from V39 to V49 such that V25 is on the path and every edge on the path has an orientation that blocks the path. If every edge on the path has an orientation that blocks the path, then V39 and V49 are d-separated given V25. If not, then V39 and V49 are not d-separated given V25.
 No.
