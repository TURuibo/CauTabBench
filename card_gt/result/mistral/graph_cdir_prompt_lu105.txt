 [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You are extracting parents and children of nodes from given responses. The response is:  The parents of each node in the causal graph are the nodes that directly cause or influence the node. The children of each node are the nodes that are directly caused or influenced by the node.\n\nFor example, the parents of node V5 are V0 and V9, since V0 and V9 directly cause or influence V5. The children of node V5 are V6 and V8, since V5 directly causes or influences V6 and V8.\n\nSimilarly, the parents of node V9 are V0, since V0 directly causes or influences V9. The children of node V9 are V5 and V8, since V9 directly causes or influences V5 and V8.\n\nThe parents of node V2 are V1, since V1 directly causes or influences V2. The children of node V2 are V6, since V2 directly causes or influences V6.\n\nThe parents of node V3 are V1, since V1 directly causes or influences V3. The children of node V3 are V8, since V3 directly causes or influences V8.\n\nThe parents of node V6 are V4 and V6, since V4 and V6 directly cause or influence V6. The children of node V6 are V8, since V6 directly causes or influences V8.\n\nThe parents of node V8 are V3 and V6, since V3 and V6 directly cause or influence V8. The children of node V8 are V9, since V8 directly causes or influences V9.\n\nThe parents of node V0 are none, since there are no nodes that directly cause or influence V0. The children of node V0 are V5 and V9, since V0 directly causes or influences V5 and V9.\n\nThe parents of node V1 are none, since there are no nodes that directly cause or influence V1. The children of node V1 are V2 and V3, since V1 directly causes or influences V2 and V3.\n\nThe parents of node V4 are none, since there are no nodes that directly cause or influence V4. The children of node V4 are V6, since V4 directly causes or influences V6.\n\nThe parents of node V7 are none, since there are no nodes that directly cause or influence V7. The children of node V7 are none, since there are no nodes that are directly caused or influenced by V7.\n\nThe parents of node V8 are none, since there are no nodes that directly cause or influence V8. The children of node V8 are V9, since V8 directly causes or influences V9.\n\nThe parents of node V9 are none, since there are no nodes that directly cause or influence V9. The children of node V9 are none, since there are no nodes that are directly caused or influenced by V9.. The result in the format: Parents of XXX are XXX, ... Children of XXX are XXX, ... where XXX should be replaced by nodes.'}]
