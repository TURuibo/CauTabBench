 [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You are extracting parents and children of nodes from given responses. The response is:  To determine the parents and children of each node in the causal graph, we need to traverse the edges and follow the direction of causality. Here are the parents and children of each node:\n\n* V0: Parents: None, Children: V2, V4, V6\n* V1: Parents: None, Children: V2, V3\n* V2: Parents: V0, V1, Children: V4, V5\n* V3: Parents: V1, Children: V5, V8, V9\n* V4: Parents: V0, Children: V8\n* V5: Parents: V2, Children: V6, V7\n* V6: Parents: V0, Children: None\n* V7: Parents: V5, Children: None\n* V8: Parents: V4, Children: None\n* V9: Parents: V3, Children: None\n\nNote that the edges are directed, so the causality flows from the parent node to the child node.. The result in the format: Parents of XXX are XXX, ... Children of XXX are XXX, ... where XXX should be replaced by nodes.'}]
