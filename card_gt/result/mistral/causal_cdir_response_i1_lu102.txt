  Here are the parents and children of each node in the causal graph:

* V0: Parents: None, Children: V2, V3, V7
* V1: Parents: None, Children: V2, V3, V5, V6, V8
* V2: Parents: V0, V1, Children: V4, V6, V8
* V3: Parents: V0, V1, Children: None
* V4: Parents: V2, Children: None
* V5: Parents: V1, Children: None
* V6: Parents: V1, V2, Children: None
* V7: Parents: V0, Children: None
* V8: Parents: V1, Children: None
* V9: Parents: V6, Children: None

Note that some nodes have multiple parents, and some nodes have no children.
