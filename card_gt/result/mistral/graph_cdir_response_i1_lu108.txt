response:
  In a causal graph, each node has parents and children. The parents of a node are the nodes that directly influence it, while the children of a node are the nodes that directly influence other nodes.

For example, in this causal graph:

* V0 has parents V1, V2, V3, V7
* V1 has children V3
* V2 has children V5, V9
* V3 has children V5, V8
* V4 has children V7
* V5 has children V8, V9
* V6 has children V7
* V7 has children V8, V9
* V8 has children V9
* V9 has children V5

Note that V0 has no children, as it does not directly influence any other nodes in the graph.
