  To determine the parents and children of each node in the causal graph, we need to follow the direction of the edges. Here are the parent-child relationships for each node:

* V0: parents: None, children: V1, V2, V3, V9
* V1: parents: V0, children: V3, V5, V6, V9
* V2: parents: V0, children: None
* V3: parents: V1, children: None
* V4: parents: None, children: None
* V5: parents: V1, children: None
* V6: parents: V1, children: None
* V7: parents: V2, children: None
* V8: parents: None, children: None
* V9: parents: V0, V1, children: None

Note that some nodes have multiple children, while others have none. Additionally, some nodes have multiple parents, while others have none.
