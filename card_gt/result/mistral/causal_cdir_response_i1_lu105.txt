  The parents of each node in the causal graph are:

* V0: V5, V9
* V1: V2, V3
* V2: V6
* V3: V8
* V4: V6
* V5: None
* V6: V8
* V7: None
* V8: None
* V9: None

The children of each node in the causal graph are:

* V0: None
* V1: None
* V2: None
* V3: None
* V4: None
* V5: None
* V6: None
* V7: None
* V8: None
* V9: None

Note that the parents and children of each node are determined by the edges of the causal graph. The parents of a node are the nodes that are connected to it with directed edges, and the children of a node are the nodes that are connected to it with directed edges in the opposite direction.
