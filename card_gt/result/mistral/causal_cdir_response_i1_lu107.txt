  In a causal graph, each node has a set of parents (also known as the causal ancestors) and a set of children (also known as the causal descendants).

The parents of each node in the causal graph are:

* V0: V3, V4
* V1: V3
* V2: V6, V8
* V3: V4
* V4: V0
* V5: V6, V8
* V6: V2
* V7: V5
* V8: V2
* V9: V7

The children of each node in the causal graph are:

* V0: V3, V4
* V1: V3
* V2: V6, V8
* V3: V4
* V4: V0
* V5: V6, V8
* V6: V2
* V7: V5
* V8: V2
* V9: V7

Note that a node can have multiple parents, but only one child node.
