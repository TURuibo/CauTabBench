 [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You are extracting neighbor information from given responses. The response is:  Here are the neighbors of each node in the causal graph:\n\n* V0: V2, V3, V7\n* V1: V2, V3, V5, V6, V8\n* V2: V4, V6, V8\n* V3: V2, V7\n* V4: V2\n* V5: V1, V6\n* V6: V1, V2, V8, V9\n* V7: V0, V3\n* V8: V1, V2, V6\n* V9: V6\n\nNote that the causal graph has a directed edge between each pair of nodes, so the neighbors of a node are the nodes that are connected to it by an edge..  The result in the format: Neighbors of XXX are XXX, ... where XXX should be replaced by nodes.'}]
