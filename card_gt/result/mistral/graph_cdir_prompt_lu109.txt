 [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You are extracting parents and children of nodes from given responses. The response is:  The parents and children of each node in the causal graph are as follows:\n\n* V0 has one parent: V2\n* V1 has one parent: V6\n* V2 has one parent: V0 and one child: V3\n* V3 has one parent: V2 and two children: V4 and V6\n* V4 has one parent: V3 and one child: V7\n* V5 has one parent: V7 and one child: V9\n* V6 has one parent: V3 and one child: V8\n* V7 has one parent: V4 and one child: V9\n* V8 has one parent: V6\n* V9 has one parent: V3 and one child: V9\n\nNote that V3 has two children, V4 and V6, since it is a node with multiple edges in the causal graph.. The result in the format: Parents of XXX are XXX, ... Children of XXX are XXX, ... where XXX should be replaced by nodes.'}]
