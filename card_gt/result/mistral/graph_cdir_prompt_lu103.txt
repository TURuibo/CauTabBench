 [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You are extracting parents and children of nodes from given responses. The response is:  To determine the parents and children of each node in the causal graph, we need to follow the edges in the graph. Here are the parent-child relationships for each node:\n\n* V0: parents: V0, children: V1, V2, V3, V9\n* V1: parents: V0, children: V0\n* V2: parents: V0, children: V0\n* V3: parents: V0, children: V0\n* V4: parents: V4, children: V6, V8\n* V6: parents: V4, children: V8\n* V7: parents: V5, children: V5\n* V8: parents: V4, V6, children: V0\n* V9: parents: V0, children: V0\n\nNote that some nodes have no children, as they are not connected to any other nodes in the graph.. The result in the format: Parents of XXX are XXX, ... Children of XXX are XXX, ... where XXX should be replaced by nodes.'}]
