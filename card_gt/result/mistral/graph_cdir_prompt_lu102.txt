The response is:  The parents of a node in a causal graph are the nodes that directly cause it, while the children of a node are the nodes that are directly caused by it.\n\nFor the causal graph you provided:\n\n* V0 has parents V1, V2, V3, and V7.\n* V1 has parents V0, V2, V3, V5, V6, and V8.\n* V2 has parents V0, V1, and V8.\n* V3 has parents V0 and V1.\n* V4 has parent V2.\n* V5 has parent V1.\n* V6 has parents V1 and V8.\n* V7 has parent V0.\n* V8 has parents V1 and V2.\n* V9 has parent V6.. The result in the format: Parents of XXX are XXX, ... Children of XXX are XXX, ... where XXX should be replaced by nodes.'}]
