  The parents of each node in the causal graph are as follows:

- V0: V1, V2, V4, V6
- V1: V2, V3
- V2: V0, V4, V5
- V3: V1, V8, V9
- V4: V2, V8
- V5: V2, V6, V7
- V6: V0, V5
- V7: V5
- V8: V3, V4
- V9: V3, V8

The children of each node in the causal graph are as follows:

- V0: V2, V4, V6
- V1: V2, V3
- V2: V4, V5
- V3: V8, V9
- V4: V8
- V5: V6, V7
- V6: V7
- V7: V8
- V8: V9
- V9: V9

Note that some nodes have multiple children, while others have no children.
