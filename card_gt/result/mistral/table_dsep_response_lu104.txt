{"question":"Are V2 and V9 conditionally independent given V1?", "answer": " To determine whether V2 and V9 are conditionally independent given V1, we need to calculate the conditional probability of V2 given V1 and V9 given V1, and compare them.We can calculate the conditional probability of V2 given V1 as follows:P(V2|V1) = P(V1,V2) / P(V1)= (0.409258, 0.2"}
