 [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You are extracting parents and children of nodes from given responses. The response is:  To determine the parents and children of each node in the causal graph, we need to follow the direction of the edges. Here are the parent-child relationships for each node:\n\n* V0: parents: None, children: V1, V2, V3, V9\n* V1: parents: V0, children: V3, V5, V6, V9\n* V2: parents: V0, children: None\n* V3: parents: V1, children: None\n* V4: parents: None, children: None\n* V5: parents: V1, children: None\n* V6: parents: V1, children: None\n* V7: parents: V2, children: None\n* V8: parents: None, children: None\n* V9: parents: V0, V1, children: None\n\nNote that some nodes have multiple children, while others have none. Additionally, some nodes have multiple parents, while others have none.. The result in the format: Parents of XXX are XXX, ... Children of XXX are XXX, ... where XXX should be replaced by nodes.'}]
