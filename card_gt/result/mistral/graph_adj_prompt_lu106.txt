 [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You are extracting neighbor information from given responses. The response is:  The neighbors of each node in the causal graph are:\n\n* V0: V2, V4, V6\n* V1: V2, V3\n* V2: V4, V5\n* V3: V5, V8, V9\n* V4: V8\n* V5: V6, V7\n* V6: V5, V7\n* V7: V5\n* V8: V4\n* V9: V3, V8\n\nNote that the neighbors of each node are the nodes that are connected to it by an edge in the causal graph..  The result in the format: Neighbors of XXX are XXX, ... where XXX should be replaced by nodes.'}]
