{"question":"Are V0 and V4 conditionally independent given V3?", "answer": " No."}
{"question":"Are V0 and V6 conditionally independent given V3?", "answer": " To determine if V0 and V6 are conditionally independent given V3, we need to calculate the conditional probability P(V0|V3) and P(V6|V3) and compare them to P(V0,V6|V3).P(V0|V3) = P(V0,V3) / P(V3)P(V6|V3) = P(V0,V6,V"}
