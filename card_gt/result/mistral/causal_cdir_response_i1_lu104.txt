  The parents of each node in the causal graph are:

* V0 has parents V0
* V1 has parents V0 and V1
* V2 has parents V0 and V2
* V3 has parents V0 and V3
* V4 has parents V0 and V4
* V5 has parents V1 and V5
* V6 has parents V1 and V6
* V7 has parents V2 and V7
* V8 has parents V0 and V8
* V9 has parents V0 and V9

The children of each node in the causal graph are:

* V0 has children V1, V2, V3, V9
* V1 has children V3, V5, V6, V9
* V2 has children V7
* V3 has children V1, V9
* V4 has no children
* V5 has children V6
* V6 has no children
* V7 has no children
