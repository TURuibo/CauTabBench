 Yes, V5 and V9 are d-separated given V4. The response explains that there is only one path between V5 and V9, and this path is blocked by V4 because V4 is a collider on this path. Therefore, V5 and V9 are d-separated given V4.
 Yes, V7 and V8 are d-separated given V6.
 No, V5 and V9 are not d-separated. The response explains that there is an open path between V5 and V9, which means that they are not d-separated in the causal graph.
 We cannot definitively say whether V7 and V8 are d-separated or not, as the response indicates that it depends on whether V6 is conditioned on or not, and this information is not provided.
