It seems that the response only provides information about the parents of each node, not the children. If the response had included information about the children of each node, the format of the summary would be: "Children of XXX are XXX,..." where XXX would be replaced by the corresponding nodes. However, since this information is not provided, I can only list the children that are explicitly mentioned in the response.
