 The answer is yes, V1 and V4 are d-separated given the set of nodes V0V3 in the causal graph. This means that V1 and V4 are independent in the probability distribution if the distribution is faithful to the graph.
 Yes, V6 and V8 are d-separated given V2. The response explains that all paths between V6 and V8 are blocked by V2 or a descendant of a collider in the conditioning set, which means that V6 and V8 are not connected by any active path given V2. Therefore, they are d-separated.
 The answer is: No, V1 and V4 are not d-separated given V3.
 Yes, V6 and V8 are d-separated. The response explains that there is no active path between V6 and V8 in the causal graph, so they are d-separated.
