###0: unknown 
######1: The answer is unknown. 
######2: The answer is unknown. 

The response explains that you need to calculate probabilities from the data to determine conditional independence. 
######3: The answer is unknown. 
######4: unknown 
######5: The answer is **unknown**. 

The response clearly states that it cannot definitively say whether V2 and V3 are conditionally independent given V0 and V1 based on the information provided.
