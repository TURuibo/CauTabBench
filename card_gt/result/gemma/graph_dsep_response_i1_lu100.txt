Question is Are V5 and V9 d-seperated given V4?

 Answer is Yes, V5 and V9 are d-separated given V4. Here's why:

**Understanding d-separation**

In a causal graph, two nodes (V5 and V9 in this case) are d-separated given a set of nodes (V4) if there is no path between them that doesn't pass through a node in the given set.

**Analyzing the Graph**

*  V4 has a direct edge to both V5 and V9.
* There are no other paths connecting V5 and V9 that don't go through V4.

**Conclusion**

Since the only path between V5 and V9 passes through V4, they are d-separated given V4.

Question is Are V7 and V8 d-seperated given V6?

 Answer is Yes, V7 and V8 are d-separated given V6. Here's why:

* **D-separation** in a causal graph means that two nodes are independent given a set of conditioning nodes if there are no active paths between them after conditioning.

* **Active path** means a path where all nodes on the path, except the conditioning nodes, have a direction pointing towards the target node.

Let's analyze the graph:

1. **V6 -> V7 and V6 -> V8:**  These are direct edges, making V7 and V8 directly connected.

2. **Conditioning on V6:**  Since V6 is our conditioning node, the edges V6 -> V7 and V6 -> V8 become "inactive" because they are directed towards V7 and V8 respectively.

3. **No active paths:** After conditioning on V6, there are no more paths connecting V7 and V8.


Therefore, V7 and V8 are d-separated given V6. 

Question is Are V5 and V9 d-seperated?

 Answer is No, V5 and V9 are not d-separated in this causal graph. 

Here's why:

* **D-separation** means that there is no path between two nodes where all the edges are directed away from the nodes in question.

*  In this graph, V4 has a direct edge to both V5 and V9.  This means there is a path between V5 and V9 where the edges are directed towards them.

Question is Are V7 and V8 d-seperated?

 Answer is Yes, V7 and V8 are d-separated in this causal graph. Here's why:

* **D-separation** in a causal graph means that two nodes are conditionally independent given the values of a set of other nodes.  

* In this graph, V7 and V8 are only connected through V6.  

* There are no other paths connecting V7 and V8, either directly or indirectly.

Therefore, given the value of V6, V7 and V8 are conditionally independent.
