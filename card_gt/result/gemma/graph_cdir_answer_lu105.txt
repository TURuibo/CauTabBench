Here's a summary of the children of each node in the causal graph:

* **Children of V0 are V5**
* **Children of V1 are V2, V3**
* **Children of V2 are V6**
* **Children of V3 are V8**
* **Children of V4 are V6**
* **Children of V6 are None** 
* **Children of V7 are None** 
* **Children of V8 are None**
