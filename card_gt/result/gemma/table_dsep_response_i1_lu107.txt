Question is Are V1 and V4 conditionally independent given V0V3?

 Answer is I can't definitively say whether V1 and V4 are conditionally independent given V0 and V3 just by looking at the table. Here's why:

* **Conditional Independence:**  To determine conditional independence, we need to examine if the distribution of V1 given V0 and V3 is the same as the distribution of V1 given V0, V3, and V4.  

* **Table Limitations:** A table only shows us the observed frequencies (or values) of the variables. It doesn't tell us the underlying probability distributions.

**What you would need to do:**

1. **Calculate Probabilities:** You'd need to calculate conditional probabilities from the table. For example:
   * P(V1 = value | V0 = value, V3 = value)
   * P(V1 = value | V0 = value, V3 = value, V4 = value)

2. **Compare Distributions:**  Compare the two probability distributions you calculated. If they are identical for all possible values of V1, V0, and V3, then V1 and V4 are conditionally independent given V0 and V3.

**Statistical Tests:**

You could also use statistical tests (like the chi-square test) to formally test for conditional independence. These tests would help you determine if the difference in the distributions you calculated is statistically significant.

Question is Are V6 and V8 conditionally independent given V2?

 Answer is I can't determine conditional independence just from looking at the data. Here's why:

* **Conditional independence** means that knowing the value of one variable (V2 in this case) doesn't give us any additional information about the relationship between two other variables (V6 and V8). 

* **To test for conditional independence**, we would need to perform statistical tests or calculations. These tests often involve looking at joint probabilities and marginal probabilities of the variables.

**Here's what you would need to do:**

1. **Calculate joint probabilities:** Find the probabilities of different combinations of values for V2, V6, and V8.
2. **Calculate marginal probabilities:** Find the probabilities of each variable (V6 and V8) independently of V2.
3. **Compare:**  If the joint probability of V6 and V8 given V2 is equal to the product of the marginal probabilities of V6 and V8, then they are conditionally independent.

Question is Are V1 and V4 conditionally independent given V3?

 Answer is I can't definitively say whether V1 and V4 are conditionally independent given V3 just by looking at the table. Here's why:

* **Conditional Independence:**  Two variables (V1 and V4 in this case) are conditionally independent given a third variable (V3) if the value of V3 doesn't change the relationship between V1 and V4.  

* **What We Need:** To determine conditional independence, we'd typically need to calculate probabilities:
    *  P(V1 = value1, V4 = value2 | V3 = value3)
    *  P(V1 = value1 | V3 = value3) * P(V4 = value2 | V3 = value3)

   We'd compare these probabilities for different combinations of values. If they are equal, then V1 and V4 are conditionally independent given V3.

* **Table Limitations:** A table only shows us the raw data. It doesn't directly provide the probabilities needed for this calculation.


**How to Proceed:**

1. **Calculate Probabilities:** You'd need to calculate the probabilities mentioned above using the data in the table.

2. **Compare Probabilities:**  Compare the joint probabilities with the product of the marginal probabilities. If they are equal for all combinations of V1, V4, and V3, then V1 and V4 are conditionally independent given V3.

Question is Are V6 and V8 independent from each other?

 Answer is I can't definitively say whether V6 and V8 are independent from each other based solely on this data. Here's why:

* **Correlation vs. Independence:**  Just because two variables (V6 and V8) don't have a strong linear relationship (correlation) doesn't automatically mean they are independent.  There could be non-linear relationships or complex dependencies.
* **Limited Data:**  The dataset you provided is relatively small.  To make reliable conclusions about independence, we'd need a much larger sample size.

**What you could do to investigate further:**

1. **Calculate Correlation:**  Compute the correlation coefficient between V6 and V8. A correlation close to 0 might suggest independence, but it's not a guarantee.
2. **Visualize the Data:** Create a scatter plot of V6 vs. V8. Look for patterns or trends that might indicate dependence.
3. **Statistical Tests:** Perform a statistical test for independence, such as the chi-squared test. This would provide a more formal assessment, but again, a larger dataset would be more informative.
