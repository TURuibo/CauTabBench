###4: Based on the provided information, we cannot determine a causal relationship. 

The response states:  It's impossible to say V6 -> V8 or V8 -> V6 (or any other direction)  because:

* **Correlation doesn't equal causation:**  Just because they are related doesn't mean one causes the other.
* **We don't know what they mean:**  Without understanding V6 and V8, we can't even guess at a
