Question is Are V0 and V5 d-seperated given V2V3?

 Answer is Let's analyze the causal graph to determine if V0 and V5 are d-separated given V2V3.

**Understanding d-separation**

In a causal graph, two nodes (V0 and V5 in this case) are d-separated given a set of nodes (V2V3) if there are no paths between them that are not blocked by the conditioning set.  A path is blocked if:

* **It contains a collider:**  A collider is a node where two incoming edges meet (e.g., V0 -> V1, V0 -> V2). Conditioning on a collider's parent(s) blocks the path.
* **It contains a tail-to-tail edge:** A tail-to-tail edge is a path where two edges point towards the same node (e.g., V0 -> V1, V1 -> V3). Conditioning on the tail node blocks the path.

**Analyzing the Graph**

1. **Paths between V0 and V5:**
   * V0 -> V2 -> V5 
   * V0 -> V3 -> V5

2. **Blocking by V2V3:**
   * The path V0 -> V2 -> V5 is blocked because V2 is in the conditioning set V2V3.
   * The path V0 -> V3 -> V5 is blocked because V3 is in the conditioning set V2V3.

**Conclusion**

Since all paths between V0 and V5 are blocked by the conditioning set V2V3, V0 and V5 are **d-separated** given V2V3. 



Question is Are V0 and V8 d-seperated given V3V7?

 Answer is Let's analyze the causal graph to determine if V0 and V8 are d-separated given V3V7.

**Understanding d-separation**

In a causal graph, two nodes are d-separated (conditionally independent) given a set of nodes if there are no paths between them that are not blocked by the conditioning set. A path is blocked if:

* It contains a node in the conditioning set that is not a descendant of the head node of the edge.
* It contains a node in the conditioning set that is an ancestor of the tail node of the edge.

**Analyzing the graph**

1. **Identify V0 and V8:**  These are our nodes of interest.

2. **Identify V3V7:** This is our conditioning set.

3. **Possible paths between V0 and V8:**

   * V0 -> V7 -> V8  

4. **Check if the paths are blocked:**

   * The path V0 -> V7 -> V8 is **not blocked** by V3V7.

**Conclusion**

Since there is at least one unblocked path between V0 and V8 given V3V7, they are **not d-separated**.

Question is Are V0 and V9 d-seperated given V2?

 Answer is Let's analyze the causal graph to determine if V0 and V9 are d-separated given V2.

**Understanding d-separation**

In a causal graph, two nodes are d-separated (conditionally independent) given a set of nodes if there are no paths between them that are not blocked by the conditioning set. A path is blocked if it contains a node in the conditioning set that is not a descendant of the tail node in the path.

**Analyzing the graph**

1. **Identify the paths between V0 and V9:**

   * V0 -> V2 -> V9 

2. **Consider the conditioning set V2:**

   *  V2 is present in the path V0 -> V2 -> V9.

3. **Determine if the path is blocked:**

   * Since V2 is in the conditioning set and is on the path, the path V0 -> V2 -> V9 is **blocked**.

**Conclusion**

Because the only path between V0 and V9 is blocked by V2, V0 and V9 are **d-separated given V2**. 



Question is Are V1 and V2 d-seperated given V0?

 Answer is Let's analyze the causal graph to determine if V1 and V2 are d-separated given V0.

**Understanding d-separation**

In a causal graph, two nodes (V1 and V2 in this case) are d-separated given a set of nodes (V0) if there is no path from V1 to V2 that doesn't pass through a node in the set V0.  

**Analyzing the graph**

* **Direct Paths:** There is no direct edge between V1 and V2.

* **Indirect Paths:** Let's look for paths that go through V0:
    * V1 -> V3 -> V5 -> V2: This path exists.

**Conclusion**

Since there is a path from V1 to V2 that goes through V0, V1 and V2 are **not d-separated** given V0.

Question is Are V1 and V5 d-seperated given V2V3?

 Answer is Let's analyze the causal graph to determine if V1 and V5 are d-separated given V2V3.

**Understanding d-separation**

In a causal graph, two nodes (V1 and V5 in our case) are d-separated given a set of nodes (V2V3) if there are no paths between V1 and V5 that are not blocked by nodes in V2V3.  A path is blocked if:

* It contains a node in V2V3 that is not a descendant of the first node in the path.
* It contains a node in V2V3 that is an ancestor of the last node in the path.

**Analyzing the Graph**

1. **Possible Paths:**  Let's look at the paths connecting V1 and V5:

   * V1 -> V3 -> V5 

2. **Blocking by V2V3:**

   * The path V1 -> V3 -> V5 passes through V3, which is in our conditioning set V2V3.  

**Conclusion**

Since the path V1 -> V3 -> V5 is blocked by V3, V1 and V5 are **d-separated** given V2V3.

Question is Are V1 and V7 d-seperated given V0?

 Answer is Let's analyze the causal graph to determine if V1 and V7 are d-separated given V0.

**Understanding d-separation**

In a causal graph, two nodes (V1 and V7 in our case) are d-separated given a set of nodes (V0) if there are no paths from V1 to V7 that don't pass through nodes in the set V0.

**Analyzing the paths**

Here are the possible paths from V1 to V7:

1. **V1 -> V3 -> V8 -> V7:** This path passes through V3 and V8, neither of which are in our conditioning set V0.

2. **V1 -> V3 -> V5 -> V2 -> V0 -> V7:** This path includes V0, so it's not a valid path for d-separation.


**Conclusion**

Since there is at least one path from V1 to V7 that doesn't pass through V0,  V1 and V7 are **not d-separated** given V0. 

Question is Are V1 and V8 d-seperated given V3V7?

 Answer is Let's analyze the causal graph to determine if V1 and V8 are d-separated given V3 and V7.

**Analyzing the Graph:**

1. **Paths from V1 to V8:**
   * V1 -> V3 -> V8 

2. **Paths passing through V3 and V7:**
   * V1 -> V3 -> V8  (This path passes through V3 and V7)

**Conclusion:**

Since there is at least one path from V1 to V8 that passes through V3 and V7, V1 and V8 are **not d-separated** given V3 and V7.

Question is Are V1 and V9 d-seperated given V2?

 Answer is Let's analyze the causal graph to determine if V1 and V9 are d-separated given V2.

**Understanding d-separation**

In a causal graph, two nodes (V1 and V9 in our case) are d-separated given a set of nodes (V2) if there are no paths connecting them where every node on the path (except the conditioning nodes) is a descendant of one of the conditioning nodes.

**Analyzing the Graph**

* **Direct Connection:** There's no direct edge between V1 and V9.
* **Indirect Connections:** Let's examine potential paths:
    * V1 -> V3 -> V5 -> V9:  This path exists. However, V2 is a conditioning node and is an ancestor of V5.  Therefore, V5 is a descendant of V2, making this path invalid for d-separation.

**Conclusion**

Since there is at least one path connecting V1 and V9 that is not blocked by V2, they are **not d-separated** given V2.

Question is Are V2 and V3 d-seperated given V0V1?

 Answer is Let's break down how to determine if V2 and V3 are d-separated given V0 and V1 in this causal graph.

**Understanding d-Separation**

In causal graphs, d-separation (direct separation) means that two nodes (V2 and V3 in our case) are not directly or indirectly influenced by each other through a path that can be blocked by a set of nodes (V0 and V1 here).

**Analyzing the Graph**

1. **Identify all paths between V2 and V3:**
   - V0 -> V2 -> V5 -> V3
   - V0 -> V1 -> V3

2. **Check if these paths are blocked by V0 and V1:**
   -  The path V0 -> V2 -> V5 -> V3 is blocked because V0 is in the set of conditioning nodes (V0V1).  The edge V0 -> V2 is "blocked" by V0.
   - The path V0 -> V1 -> V3 is **not** blocked because V1 is in the conditioning set, but V0 is not on the path between V1 and V3.

**Conclusion**

Since there is at least one unblocked path between V2 and V3 given V0V1, they are **not d-separated**.

**Analyzing the paths**

Here are the possible paths connecting V2 and V7:

1. **V2 -> V5 -> V3 -> V8 -> V7:** This path does not pass through V0.

2. **V2 -> V9:** This path does not connect to V7.

3. **V0 -> V7:** This path passes through V0.

**Conclusion**

Since there is a path connecting V2 and V7 that passes through V0, they are **not d-separated** given V0.

Question is Are V2 and V8 d-seperated given V3V7?

 Answer is Let's analyze the causal graph to determine if V2 and V8 are d-separated given V3V7.

**Understanding d-separation:**

* **D-separation** in a causal graph means that two nodes (in this case, V2 and V8) are conditionally independent given a set of nodes (V3V7).  
* This means that knowing the values of V3 and V7 doesn't provide any additional information about the causal relationship between V2 and V8.

**Analyzing the graph:**

1. **V3V7 as a conditioning set:**  We are conditioning on V3 and V7. This means we are assuming we know the values of both V3 and V7.

2. **Paths between V2 and V8:**  Let's look at all the possible paths from V2 to V8:
   * **V2 -> V5 -> V3 -> V8:** This path is blocked because V3 is in our conditioning set (V3V7).

3. **No other paths:** There are no other paths from V2 to V8 that are not blocked by V3 or V7.


**Conclusion:**

Since there are no open paths from V2 to V8 given V3V7, we can conclude that **V2 and V8 are d-separated given V3V7**. 

Question is Are V3 and V7 d-seperated given V0?

 Answer is Let's analyze the causal graph to determine if V3 and V7 are d-separated given V0.

**Understanding d-separation:**

*  **Directly connected:** If two nodes are directly connected by an edge, they are not d-separated.
* **Path with an unblocked arrow:** If there's a path between two nodes with all arrows pointing in the same direction (either all towards or all away from the target node), they are not d-separated.
* **Path with a blocked arrow:** If there's a path between two nodes, and at least one arrow points towards a node in the conditioning set (V0 in this case), the path is blocked.

**Analyzing the graph:**

1. **Direct Connection:** V3 and V7 are not directly connected.

2. **Paths:** Let's look for paths between V3 and V7:
   *  V3 -> V5 -> V2 -> V0 -> V7: This path has a blocked arrow pointing towards V0 (our conditioning set).

3. **Conclusion:** Since all paths between V3 and V7 have at least one blocked arrow when conditioning on V0,  V3 and V7 are **d-separated** given V0.

Question is Are V3 and V9 d-seperated given V2?

 Answer is Yes, V3 and V9 are d-separated given V2. Here's why:

**Understanding d-separation**

In causal graphs, d-separation (direct separation) means that two nodes are conditionally independent given a set of other nodes.  

* **Path:** A path between two nodes is a sequence of connected edges.
* **Active Path:** A path is active given a set of nodes (evidence) if there's at least one edge in the path that is not in the set of evidence and has a direction pointing towards one of the nodes being tested for independence.

**Analyzing the Graph**

1. **V3 and V9:** There's a path from V3 to V9 through V2: V3 -> V5 -> V2 -> V9.

2. **Evidence: V2:** Since V2 is in our evidence set, the edge V2 -> V9 becomes inactive.

3. **Result:**  The path V3 -> V5 -> V2 -> V9 is no longer active because of the inactive edge V2 -> V9. Therefore, V3 and V9 are d-separated given V2.

Question is Are V4 and V8 d-seperated given V3V7?

 Answer is Let's analyze the causal graph to determine if V4 and V8 are d-separated given V3V7.

**Understanding d-separation**

In a causal graph, two nodes are d-separated (directly separated) if there is no path between them that consists entirely of directed edges, where all the edges point in the same direction.

**Analyzing the graph**

* **V3V7:**  This means we are conditioning on nodes V3 and V7.

* **Path from V4 to V8:**  There is a path from V4 to V8: V4 -> V7 -> V8.

* **Effect of conditioning:**  Since V7 is in our conditioning set (V3V7), the edge V7 -> V8 is blocked.

* **Remaining path:** This leaves us with V4 -> V7.


**Conclusion**

V4 and V8 are **not** d-separated given V3V7 because there is still a path (V4 -> V7) connecting them, even after blocking the V7 -> V8 edge. 

Question is Are V5 and V7 d-seperated given V0?

 Answer is Let's analyze the causal graph to determine if V5 and V7 are d-separated given V0.

**Analyzing the paths**

Here are the possible paths between V5 and V7, considering the conditioning set V0:

* **Path 1:** V0 -> V3 -> V5, V7
* **Path 2:** V0 -> V7 -> V8 -> V5

**d-separation conclusion**

Since there are paths connecting V5 and V7 that pass through V0, they are **not d-separated** given V0.

Question is Are V5 and V8 d-seperated given V3V7?

 Answer is Let's analyze the causal graph to determine if V5 and V8 are d-separated given V3 and V7.

**Understanding d-separation**

In a causal graph, two nodes are d-separated (conditionally independent) given a set of nodes if:

1. **No path connects them directly.**
2. **No path connects them indirectly through a collider.**  A collider is a node where two directed edges converge.

**Analyzing the graph**

* **V5 and V8 are connected:** There is a direct path from V3 to V5 and from V3 to V8.

* **The influence of V3 and V7:**

    * V3 is a common ancestor of V5 and V8.
    * V7 is connected to both V3 and V8.

* **Path through V7:**  There is a path from V3 to V7 to V8. This path is not blocked by V3 and V7.


**Conclusion**

Since there is a path from V5 to V8 that is not blocked by V3 and V7, V5 and V8 are **not d-separated** given V3 and V7. 

Question is Are V5 and V9 d-seperated given V2?

 Answer is Yes, V5 and V9 are d-separated given V2. Here's why:

**Understanding d-separation**

In causal graphs, d-separation (directed separation) means that two nodes (V5 and V9 in this case) are conditionally independent given the values of a set of nodes (V2).  

**Analyzing the graph**

* **V2 is a common ancestor:** V2 is a direct ancestor of both V5 and V9.
* **No backdoor paths:** There are no paths from V2 to V5 or V9 that go through other nodes in a way that would create a dependency.  

**Conclusion**

Since V2 is a common ancestor and there are no backdoor paths, V5 and V9 are d-separated given V2.  This means that knowing the value of V2 tells us nothing about the relationship between V5 and V9.

**Analyzing the Graph**

1. **Direct Connections:** V2 is directly connected to V5 and V9.

2. **Paths through V2:**  Let's examine possible paths between V7 and V9:
   *  V7 -> V8 -> V5 -> V9: This path goes through V5 and V8, which are not in the set V2.

3. **Indirect Connections:**  There are no other paths connecting V7 and V9 that pass through V2.


**Conclusion**

Since there are no paths connecting V7 and V9 that pass through V2, we can conclude that **V7 and V9 are d-separated given V2.** 

Question is Are V8 and V9 d-seperated given V2?

 Answer is Let's analyze the causal graph to determine if V8 and V9 are d-separated given V2.

**Understanding d-separation**

In a causal graph, two nodes are d-separated (conditionally independent) given a set of nodes if there are no paths between them that are not blocked by the conditioning set. A path is blocked if it contains a node in the conditioning set that is not a direct descendant of the node causing the path.

**Analyzing the Graph**

1. **Identify V8 and V9:** These are our target nodes.

2. **Identify V2:** This is our conditioning set.

3. **Find all paths between V8 and V9:**

   *  V2 -> V5 -> V3 -> V8 
   *  V2 -> V9 

4. **Check if paths are blocked:**

   * The path V2 -> V5 -> V3 -> V8 is **not blocked** by V2.
   * The path V2 -> V9 is **not blocked** by V2.

**Conclusion**

Since there are unblocked paths between V8 and V9, they are **not d-separated** given V2.

**Analyzing the Graph**

1. **Direct Path:** There's no direct edge from V0 to V8.

2. **Indirect Paths:** Let's examine possible indirect paths:
   * V0 -> V7 -> V8 : This path exists.

3. **Effect of V7:**  Since V7 is in our conditioning set (Z), the path V0 -> V7 -> V8 is blocked.

**Conclusion**

Because the only path from V0 to V8 is blocked by V7, V0 and V8 are **d-separated** given V7.

**Understanding d-separation**

In a causal graph, two nodes are d-separated (directly separated) if there is no path between them where all the edges along the path are directed away from the target node.

**Analyzing the graph**

* **Path 1:** V0 -> V1 -> V3 -> V8 -> V7 
    * This path has edges directed both towards and away from V7, so it doesn't count for d-separation.

* **Path 2:** V0 -> V7
    * This path has edges directed towards V7, so it doesn't count for d-separation.

* **Path 3:** V0 -> V1 -> V3 -> V5 -> V2 -> V9 
    * This path has edges directed both towards and away from V7, so it doesn't count for d-separation.

    * This path also does not pass through V7.

**Conclusion**

Since there is at least one path (Path 1) from V1 to V8 that passes through V7,  V1 and V8 are **not d-separated** given V7.

Question is Are V2 and V3 d-seperated given V1?

 Answer is Let's analyze the causal graph to determine if V2 and V3 are d-separated given V1.

**Understanding d-separation**

In a causal graph, two nodes are d-separated (directedly separated) given a set of nodes if there are no paths between them that involve only directed edges and don't pass through any nodes in the given set.

**Analyzing the graph**

1. **Direct paths:** There's a direct path from V2 to V5 and V9, and a direct path from V3 to V5 and V8.

2. **Paths through V1:**  The only path connecting V2 and V3 that passes through V1 is: V0 -> V1 -> V3.

3. **d-separation:** Since the path V0 -> V1 -> V3 is the only path connecting V2 and V3 and it passes through V1,  V2 and V3 are **not** d-separated given V1.



**Therefore, the answer is no.**

Question is Are V2 and V7 d-seperated?

 Answer is Let's analyze the causal graph to determine if V2 and V7 are d-separated.

**Understanding d-separation**

In a causal graph, two nodes are d-separated (conditionally independent) if there is no path between them where all the edges along the path are directed away from the conditioning set.

**Analyzing the graph**

*  **Direct Paths:** There is no direct edge between V2 and V7.

*  **Indirect Paths:** We need to check for indirect paths:
    * V2 -> V0 -> V7 : This path has an edge directed towards V0, so it's not a valid d-separation path.

**Conclusion**

Since there are no valid paths between V2 and V7 where all edges are directed away from a conditioning set (which we haven't specified), we can conclude that **V2 and V7 are d-separated**.

**Understanding d-separation**

In a causal graph, two nodes (V2 and V8 in our case) are d-separated given a set of nodes (V7) if there are no paths between them that involve only arrows pointing away from the conditioning set (V7). 

**Analyzing the paths**

Here are the possible paths between V2 and V8:

* **Path 1:** V2 -> V5 -> V3 -> V8 
* **Path 2:** V2 -> V9 (This path doesn't lead to V8)

**Conditional on V7**

* **Path 1:**  V7 is a common ancestor of V3 and V5. Since the arrows point away from V7 in this path (V7 -> V8), Path 1 is blocked.

* **Path 2:**  This path is irrelevant as it doesn't lead to V8.


**Conclusion**

Since all paths between V2 and V8 are blocked given V7, we can conclude that **V2 and V8 are d-separated given V7**. 

Question is Are V3 and V7 d-seperated?

 Answer is Let's analyze the causal graph to determine if V3 and V7 are d-separated.

**Understanding d-separation**

In a causal graph, two nodes (V3 and V7 in our case) are d-separated if there is no path between them where every edge is directed away from the target node (V7).  

**Analyzing the Graph**

1. **Direct Path:** There is a direct path from V3 to V7: V3 -> V8 -> V7

2. **Indirect Paths:**  Let's examine if there are any indirect paths where the edges point away from V7:

   * There are no paths that lead from V3 to V7 without passing through V8.

**Conclusion**

Since there is a direct path V3 -> V8 -> V7, V3 and V7 are **not d-separated**.

Question is Are V3 and V9 d-seperated?

 Answer is Let's analyze the causal graph to determine if V3 and V9 are d-separated.

**Understanding d-separation**

In a causal graph, two nodes are d-separated (directedly separated) if there is no path between them where all the edges along the path are directed away from the target node.

**Analyzing the Graph**

*  **Direct Path:** There's no direct edge connecting V3 and V9.

* **Indirect Paths:**  Let's examine potential indirect paths:
    * V3 -> V5 -> V9: This path exists, and all edges are directed away from V9.

**Conclusion**

Since there is at least one path (V3 -> V5 -> V9) where all edges are directed away from V9,  V3 and V9 are **not d-separated**.

Question is Are V4 and V8 d-seperated given V7?

 Answer is Let's analyze the causal graph to determine if V4 and V8 are d-separated given V7.

**Understanding d-separation**

In a causal graph, two nodes are d-separated (conditionally independent) given a set of nodes if there are no paths between them that are not blocked by the conditioning set.  A path is blocked if:

* It contains a node in the conditioning set that is not a descendant of any other node in the path.
* It contains a node in the conditioning set that is an ancestor of all other nodes in the path.

**Analyzing the graph**

1. **Identify V4 and V8:**  These are our target nodes.

2. **Consider V7 as the conditioning set:**  We need to see if there are any paths between V4 and V8 that are not blocked by V7.

3. **Possible paths:**

   *  V4 -> V7 -> V8: This path is **not blocked** by V7.

4. **Conclusion:**

Since there is a path (V4 -> V7 -> V8) between V4 and V8 that is not blocked by V7, they are **not d-separated** given V7.

Question is Are V5 and V7 d-seperated?

 Answer is Let's analyze the causal graph to determine if V5 and V7 are d-separated.

**Understanding d-separation**

In a causal graph, two nodes are d-separated if there is no path between them where all the edges along the path are directed away from the target node.  

**Analyzing the Graph**

* **Direct Path:** There is a direct path from V7 -> V8, and V8 -> V5. This path has edges directed towards V5.

* **Indirect Paths:**  Let's see if there are any indirect paths:

    * V7 -> V0 -> V2 -> V5: This path has edges directed towards V5.

**Conclusion**

Since there are paths from V7 to V5 where all edges are directed away from V5,  **V5 and V7 are not d-separated**.

Question is Are V5 and V8 d-seperated given V7?

 Answer is Let's analyze the causal graph to determine if V5 and V8 are d-separated given V7.

**Understanding d-separation**

In a causal graph, two nodes are d-separated (conditionally independent) given a set of nodes if there are no paths between them that involve only arrows pointing away from the conditioning set.  

**Analyzing the graph**

* **V7 as the conditioning set:**  We need to consider all paths between V5 and V8 that might be affected by conditioning on V7.

* **Possible paths:**
    * V2 -> V5 -> V3 -> V8 
    * V0 -> V7 -> V8

* **Path analysis:**
    * The path V2 -> V5 -> V3 -> V8 is broken because V7 is not on this path.
    * The path V0 -> V7 -> V8 is intact.

**Conclusion**

Since there is a path V0 -> V7 -> V8 connecting V5 and V8 even after conditioning on V7,  V5 and V8 are **not d-separated** given V7.

Question is Are V5 and V9 d-seperated?

 Answer is Let's analyze the causal graph to determine if V5 and V9 are d-separated.

**Understanding d-separation**

In a causal graph, two nodes are d-separated (directedly separated) if there is no path from one node to the other where all the edges along the path are directed away from the target node.  

**Analyzing the Graph**

* **Path 1:** V2 -> V5 -> V9 

This path has all edges directed towards V9, so it doesn't satisfy the d-separation condition.


* **Other Paths:** There are no other paths connecting V5 and V9.

**Conclusion**

Since there is at least one path from V5 to V9 where all edges are directed towards V9,  V5 and V9 are **not d-separated** in this causal graph. 

Question is Are V7 and V9 d-seperated?

 Answer is Let's analyze the causal graph to determine if V7 and V9 are d-separated.

**Understanding d-separation**

In a causal graph, two nodes (V7 and V9 in this case) are d-separated if there is no path between them where all the edges are directed away from the target node (V9).  

**Analyzing the Graph**

* **Direct Path:** There is no direct edge connecting V7 and V9.
* **Indirect Paths:** We need to examine if there are any paths connecting V7 and V9 through other nodes where all edges point away from V9. 

Let's consider possible paths:

1. V7 -> V8 -> V3 -> V2 -> V9:  This path has an edge (V2 -> V9) pointing towards V9, so it's not a valid d-separation path.

*There are no other paths connecting V7 and V9.*

**Conclusion**

Since there is at least one path connecting V7 and V9 where not all edges point away from V9,  V7 and V9 are **not d-separated**. 



Question is Are V8 and V9 d-seperated?

 Answer is Let's analyze the causal graph to determine if V8 and V9 are d-separated.

**Understanding d-separation**

In a causal graph, two nodes are d-separated if there is no path between them where all the edges along the path are directed away from the target node.  

**Analyzing the Graph**

* **Direct Paths:** There is no direct edge connecting V8 and V9.
* **Indirect Paths:** Let's examine potential indirect paths:
    * V0 -> V2 -> V9: This path has an edge (V2 -> V9) directed towards V9, so it's not a d-separated path.

**Conclusion**

Since there's at least one path connecting V8 and V9 where all edges are not directed away from V9,  **V8 and V9 are not d-separated**.
