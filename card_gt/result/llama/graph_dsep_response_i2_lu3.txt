Based on the response, the answer is: **No**

The response states that the question is invalid because V12 is not a node in the graph, so it's not possible to determine if V0 and V12 are d-separated given V6 and V9.

* V4 and V9 are not d-separated, but the question was about V12 and V49, so the answer is NO.
assistant

Based on the response, the answer is: NO

**No**

(The reason is that the nodes V13, V29, and V25 do not exist in the given causal graph, making it impossible to determine whether they are d-separated given V25.)

**No**

V13 and V34 are not d-separated given V25.
